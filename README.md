# cloudflare-check-new-dns-records
Check for new dns records in cloudflare (API) and send them to telegram (BOT) message if found some new records. And the most important thing about this script is that you need to obtain a `telegram_chat_id` you might want to find out more about it elsewhere because I haven't had the chance to explain it here, hahaha.
